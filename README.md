# Predicting of Material Failure Properties Using Persistent Homology and Deep Learning

### Introduction
This work introduces a novel method to predict material failure behaviors based on a combination of persistent homology (PH) and deep multimodal learning.

### Compatibility
We tested the codes with:
  1) Tensorflow-GPU 1.13.1 under Ubuntu 18.04 and Anaconda3 (Python 3.7 or above)
  2) Tensorflow-GPU 1.13.1/Tensorflow 1.13.1 under Windows 10 and Anaconda3 (Python 3.7 or above)


### Requirements
  1) [Anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section)
  2) [TensorFlow-GPU 1.13.1 or Tensorflow 1.13.1](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip)
  3) [HomCloud API](https://homcloud.dev/python-api/)
